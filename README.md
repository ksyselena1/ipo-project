"IPO Success Prediction"

Netids: mw734, sk2426, vp237, cw725

For this project, we are looking to answer the following question: What is the most reliable predictor that can be used to predict the success of an IPO? Potential predictors include industries/sectors, locations, the number of years the company had been operating before going IPO, which day of the week the stock went public on.
