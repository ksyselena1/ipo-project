Members: Max Wu (mw734), Selena Kang (sk2426), Abby Pham (vp237), Charles Wu (cw725)

An Initial Public Offering (IPO) is the first sale of stocks issued by a company to the public. For this project, we are looking to answer the following question regarding IPO: What is the most reliable predictor that can be used to predict the success of an IPO? Potential predictors include industries/sectors, locations, the number of years the company had been operating before going IPO, which day of the week the stock went public on.
